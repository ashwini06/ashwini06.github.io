This morning in a meeting session with my co-supervisor, came up with talk that - through **Github** one can create website or blog pages. 
Always wanted to have my own website but never get a time to lookup how to create website pages. But today I felt to create one for me atleast a start so that I can continue editing when I have time.
So after meeting when I came back to my workplace, went through this [blog](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) which clearly explains what to do in a next step-by step manner. I felt its pretty clear and straight-forwarded to begin with.

Came to know about [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)  - which is one of powerful statitic website generator (like wordpress)
