This morning in a meeting session with my co-supervisor, came up with talk that - through **Github** one can create website or blog pages. 
Always wanted to have my own website but never got a time to lookup how to create website pages. But today I felt to create one for me atleast a start so that I can continue editing when I have time.

**Purpose**                    
I feel its good to have one-            
> To write blogs which details about my new learnings from my daily work.             
> acts like a trace back about my own research.         
Bridges me to other people about my work.       

**Summary**
