This morning in a meeting session with my co-supervisor, came up with talk that - through github one can create website or blog pages. 
Always wanted to have my own website but never get a time to lookup how to create website pages. But today I felt to create one for me atleast a start so I can finish when I have time.
So after I came back to my workplace, went through this blog <a href http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages /a> which clearly explains what to do in a next step-by step manner.

Came to know about jekyll<a href http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/> jekyll </a> - which is one of powerful statitic website generator (like wordpress)
